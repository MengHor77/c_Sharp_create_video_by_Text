1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,723
Learning to speak English fluently with your friends is not

2
00:00:04,723 --> 00:00:10,442
something that happens overnight, but it becomes much easier when

3
00:00:10,442 --> 00:00:13,946
you follow the right habits and methods

4
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:18,315
The first and most important thing is *consistency*

5
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:23,893
You must expose yourself to English every single day, even

6
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:27,347
if only for ten or fifteen minutes

7
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:33,416
Your brain learns languages through repetition, so small and steady

8
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:38,545
practice is better than studying for many hours only once

9
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:40,154
a week

10
00:00:40,154 --> 00:00:46,783
Start by listening to English conversations from movies, YouTube channels,

11
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:52,891
podcasts, or even small dialogue videos made for learners

12
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:58,180
When you listen, do not try to understand every single

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,724
word

14
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:05,143
Instead, focus on the main ideas, the tone, and the

15
00:01:05,143 --> 00:01:08,327
natural flow of the sentences

16
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:14,250
Listening helps your mouth automatically learn correct pronunciation and rhythm

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,714
Next, you need to *shadow* native speakers

18
00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:23,948
Shadowing means listening to a sentence and repeating it immediately,

19
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:29,427
copying the pronunciation, speed, stress, and emotion

20
00:01:29,427 --> 00:01:35,580
You can find short clips, turn on subtitles, and repeat

21
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,474
them three or four times until your mouth becomes comfortable

22
00:01:40,474 --> 00:01:42,643
with the sounds

23
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:48,377
Shadowing is extremely helpful because it trains your speaking muscles

24
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:54,260
and makes your pronunciation more natural, especially if your goal

25
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,229
is to speak with friends in a casual, confident way

26
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:05,888
Another important step is learning simple *daily vocabulary and real-life

27
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:08,617
expressions*

28
00:02:08,617 --> 00:02:14,325
Many learners try to memorize difficult words, but you only

29
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:18,829
need the words that help you communicate in daily life:

30
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:25,943
greetings, opinions, feelings, preferences, questions, and friendly comments

31
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:30,997
Write down phrases such as “I think…,” “In my opinion…,”

32
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:35,496
“That sounds great,” “Can you explain that again

33
00:02:35,496 --> 00:02:37,635
” “What do you mean

34
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:41,154
” and “Let me try to say it another way

35
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:45,403
” These expressions are used all the time in real

36
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:50,356
conversations and will instantly make you sound more fluent

37
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:56,900
To improve even faster, you must *practice speaking regularly*, even

38
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,509
if you don’t have a partner

39
00:02:59,509 --> 00:03:05,418
You can talk to yourself, describe your day, explain your

40
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:09,777
plans, or summarize something you watched

41
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:14,241
Speaking out loud builds confidence and removes fear

42
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:19,464
When you do talk with friends, don’t worry about mistakes

43
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:21,254
or grammar

44
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:27,187
Fluency grows when you focus on expressing ideas, not when

45
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:29,991
you focus on perfection

46
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:33,705
If you make a mistake, keep going

47
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:37,359
Native speakers also make mistakes

48
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:41,603
Another powerful technique is to *think in English*

49
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:47,647
Start with simple sentences in your mind: “I’m walking,” “I’m

50
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:53,056
cooking,” “Today is hot,” “I’m going to meet my friend

51
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:57,410
” When you think in English, you reduce the time

52
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,664
needed to translate from your native language, and this makes

53
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:06,208
your speech faster and more natural

54
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:10,616
Finally, create a fun learning environment

55
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:16,700
Watch content you enjoy, listen to English music, read short

56
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,854
stories, or chat with friends online

57
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:26,013
The more positive emotion you bring to learning, the faster

58
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:29,472
your brain remembers new information

59
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:36,075
Over time, your confidence will grow, your vocabulary will expand,

60
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:40,939
and you will feel more comfortable speaking English freely with

61
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,903
your friends
