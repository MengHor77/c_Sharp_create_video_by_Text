00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,897
THE DAY I FOUND MY HIDDEN TALENT

2
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:08,862
The day I found my hidden talent began like any

3
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:14,818
other ordinary morning in my quiet village, where the sun

4
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:20,947
rose lazily above the rice fields, the birds chirped in

5
00:00:20,947 --> 00:00:27,888
soft melodies, and the ght, patience, and belief

6
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:32,526
And once they bloom, they change everything
