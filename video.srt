1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,219
THE JOURNEY TO THE MOUNTAIN OF DREAMS
The wind was gentle

2
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:11,196
when Dara first heard the old legend of the Mountain

3
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:17,026
of Dreams, a place hidden beyond the three valleys where

4
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:23,122
every wish, if spoken with a true heart, could come

5
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:25,328
to life

6
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:30,204
Dara grew up in a small wooden house beside a

7
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:36,278
rice field, living with his grandmother who always told him

8
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:39,551
stories before bedtime

9
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:44,392
Among them all, the one he loved most was the

10
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:51,822
story about the mountain where ordinary people discovered extraordinary things

11
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:54,611
about themselves

12
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:59,373
As a child, he thought it was just a tale

13
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:04,703
created to make him sleep early, but as he grew

14
00:01:04,703 --> 00:01:13,519
older and life became heavier—full of responsibilities, expectations, and silent

15
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:19,079
fears—the story began to feel like a whisper calling him

16
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,670
At twenty years old, unsure of what he wanted in

17
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:31,286
life, confused about his future, and feeling lost in the

18
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:36,696
noise of the world, Dara made a decision he had

19
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:42,364
never dared before: he would find the Mountain of Dreams

20
00:01:42,364 --> 00:01:48,679
He left home on a warm morning before sunrise, carrying

21
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:55,646
nothing but a small backpack with rice cakes, water, his

22
00:01:55,646 --> 00:02:01,856
grandmother’s scarf, and an old notebook where he wrote his

23
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,976
thoughts

24
00:02:03,976 --> 00:02:09,530
The village was still asleep, but he felt the world

25
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:16,245
watching him, almost as if the trees, birds, and soft

26
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:20,064
glow of dawn were encouraging him

27
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:24,504
The first part of the journey took him through the

28
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:31,624
familiar countryside: the narrow dirt road, the fishpond where he

29
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:36,775
and his friends used to swim, and the old mango

30
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:41,031
tree where he carved his name as a child

31
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:48,628
But as he walked farther, everything became new—strange paths, unknown

32
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:54,590
hills, and thick forests filled with sounds he had never

33
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,868
heard before

34
00:02:56,868 --> 00:03:01,759
Every step felt like leaving a piece of his old

35
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,308
life behind

36
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:10,110
By midday, he reached the *First Valley*, known as the

37
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,869
*Valley of Echoes*

38
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:17,351
It was said that anyone who entered would hear a

39
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:21,617
voice that repeated their deepest doubts

40
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:27,223
Dara hesitated, but he forced himself forward

41
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:32,555
As soon as he stepped inside, he heard it—his own

42
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:40,775
voice whispering, “You’re not strong enough… You will fail… You’re

43
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:46,787
wasting time…” The valley was silent except for the echo

44
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:52,260
of his fears circling around him like invisible birds

45
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,368
His steps slowed down

46
00:03:55,368 --> 00:04:00,770
At some point, he even thought of returning home

47
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:08,056
But then he remembered his grandmother’s words: *“Courage does not

48
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:13,597
mean the absence of fear; it means walking through fear

49
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:15,686
with hope

50
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:20,937
”* So he took a deep breath and shouted with

51
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:25,490
all his strength, “I will continue

52
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,235
” The echo repeated his words louder than before

53
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:36,324
The valley shook slightly as if approving his courage, and

54
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:41,526
the echoes of doubt faded away until there was nothing

55
00:04:41,526 --> 00:04:44,762
left except silence

56
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:50,579
Beyond the valley, Dara found a small river with clear

57
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,436
water

58
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:57,771
He sat down to rest, dipping his feet into the

59
00:04:57,771 --> 00:05:00,075
cool stream

60
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:05,552
A group of children from a nearby village ran past

61
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:10,573
him, laughing and splashing water at each other

62
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:14,909
One of the children asked where he was going

63
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:21,674
When Dara answered, “To the Mountain of Dreams,” the children’s

64
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:25,217
eyes widened with excitement

65
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:31,047
They said many travelers passed this way, but only a

66
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,938
few reached the mountain

67
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:39,589
Some turned back because the road was too long, some

68
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:45,409
because they were afraid, and some because they realized they

69
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:49,154
didn’t truly know what they wanted

70
00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:55,523
Dara thanked the children and continued walking, feeling lighter

71
00:05:55,523 --> 00:06:00,824
Even if the path was difficult, he now knew he

72
00:06:00,824 --> 00:06:04,329
wasn’t the only one searching

73
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:11,239
By late afternoon, Dara arrived at the *Second Valley*, known

74
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:14,411
as the *Valley of Mirrors*

75
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:21,155
Instead of doubts, this valley showed illusions—images of what could

76
00:06:21,155 --> 00:06:26,659
have been, what should have been, and what he wished

77
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:29,277
he had done better

78
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:34,718
As he walked, he saw reflections in the air like

79
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:37,437
floating glass

80
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:43,301
One mirror showed him becoming a teacher, another showed him

81
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:49,788
staying in his village helping his grandmother, another displayed him

82
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:55,368
working in a big city but looking miserable, and another

83
00:06:55,368 --> 00:07:01,050
showed him as a traveler, moving from country to country

84
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,062
He felt overwhelmed

85
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:07,221
Which one was truly him

86
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:11,367
Which path was he supposed to choose

87
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:16,905
He realized that this valley was not testing his fears;

88
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:20,371
it was testing his identity

89
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:24,930
He knelt on the ground and placed his hand on

90
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,033
his heart

91
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:32,234
“I don’t know who I will become yet,” he whispered,

92
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:37,068
“but I want to become someone who isn’t afraid to

93
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:38,929
try

94
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:44,856
” The mirrors shattered into soft light, clearing the path

95
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:46,981
forward

96
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:51,564
The journey became harder as night approached

97
00:07:51,564 --> 00:07:56,853
Dara found a quiet spot under a large tree and

98
00:07:56,853 --> 00:08:00,949
slept with the stars glowing above him

99
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:07,099
His dreams were strange: he saw a tall mountain covered

100
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:12,475
in mist, a door made of stone, and a voice

101
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:17,142
telling him, “Not all dreams are wishes

102
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:21,924
Some dreams are truths waiting to be discovered

103
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:26,662
” When he woke up, the dream stayed in his

104
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:31,261
mind like a shadow he could not shake off

105
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:38,045
On the second day, Dara reached the *Forest of Unfinished

106
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:40,982
Paths*

107
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:47,883
Every few meters, he saw roads splitting into different directions,

108
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:51,754
each leading to unknown places

109
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:57,179
The forest was confusing, and it was easy to get

110
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:59,192
lost

111
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:06,180
Dara walked carefully, marking trees with small scratches so he

112
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,022
would remember his way

113
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:15,351
This forest represented all the decisions people start but never

114
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:25,054
finish—projects abandoned halfway, relationships broken by fear, goals forgotten because

115
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:27,872
of distractions

116
00:09:27,872 --> 00:09:32,106
Dara felt tired as he walked deeper

117
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:37,490
He suddenly realized how many times in his life he

118
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:43,083
wanted to do something but stopped when it became difficult

119
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:48,967
The forest reminded him of every unfinished goal he left

120
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:51,109
behind

121
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:55,293
But this time, he pushed forward

122
00:09:55,293 --> 00:10:01,775
“One finished journey,” he told himself, “is better than a

123
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:05,366
thousand unfinished ones

124
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:11,398
”
After hours of walking, Dara reached a wooden bridge hanging

125
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:14,203
above a deep ravine

126
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:19,294
Standing at the entrance was an old man dressed in

127
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:22,153
simple clothes

128
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:27,493
His eyes were calm but sharp, like someone who had

129
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,349
seen many things

130
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:34,299
“Are you going to the Mountain of Dreams

131
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:37,210
” the old man asked

132
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,588
Dara nodded

133
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:43,199
The old man smiled faintly

134
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:49,229
“Then you must answer one question before crossing this bridge:

135
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:52,673
What is the dream you are chasing

136
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:55,282
” Dara froze

137
00:10:55,282 --> 00:11:00,336
He had come all this way, but he still didn’t

138
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:03,326
know his exact dream

139
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:06,901
Was he looking for success

140
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:08,926
Peace

141
00:11:08,926 --> 00:11:10,772
Meaning

142
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:13,172
A new life

143
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:18,460
Or simply a place where he could understand himself

144
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:24,080
“I… I’m not sure yet,” Dara admitted

145
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,796
The old man looked at him quietly for a long

146
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:30,826
moment

147
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:36,556
Then he said, “The uncertain dreamer may still cross the

148
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:41,945
bridge—but only if he promises not to run away from

149
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:45,447
whatever truth he finds

150
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:47,825
” Dara nodded

151
00:11:47,825 --> 00:11:53,235
With that, the old man stepped aside and allowed him

152
00:11:53,235 --> 00:11:55,506
to pass

153
00:11:55,506 --> 00:12:00,130
Beyond the bridge, the air grew colder

154
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,684
The mountain was getting closer

155
00:12:03,684 --> 00:12:09,025
Dara could see its shape now—a tall peak covered by

156
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:15,446
clouds, glowing softly as if touched by something magical

157
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:20,256
The sight filled him with both excitement and fear

158
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:26,763
For the first time, he wondered: *What if the mountain

159
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:30,473
shows me a truth I don’t like

160
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:33,433
What if I am not worthy

161
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:38,988
By the third day, Dara reached the *Foot of the

162
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:44,683
Mountain*, where the final challenge began

163
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:48,372
The climb was steep and slippery

164
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:53,310
The wind blew hard, and at times he had to

165
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,934
crawl on his hands and knees to avoid falling

166
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:04,049
There were moments when he doubted his strength, moments when

167
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:08,229
he wanted to stop and rest forever

168
00:13:08,229 --> 00:13:13,880
But each time, he remembered the people who believed in

169
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:20,759
him his grandmother, his childhood friends, the children in the

170
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:26,070
second village, even the old man on the bridge

171
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,107
Their faces became his strength

172
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:35,964
Halfway up the mountain, Dara found a cave where ancient

173
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:39,461
carvings covered the walls

174
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:45,947
The carvings told stories of travelers like him—people who searched

175
00:13:45,947 --> 00:13:53,319
for courage, forgiveness, healing, purpose, or love

176
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:57,817
Some succeeded; others turned back

177
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:03,728
Dara touched the carvings gently and whispered, “I hope I

178
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:06,472
can finish this

179
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:11,940
”
The higher he climbed, the more the world changed

180
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,750
The clouds were so close he could reach out and

181
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,847
touch them

182
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:22,958
The ground shimmered like silver dust

183
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,617
The air felt lighter, almost sacred

184
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:34,304
At last, after hours of climbing, Dara reached a massive

185
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:38,491
stone gate standing alone on the peak

186
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:43,582
This was the **Door of Truth**, the entrance to the

187
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,436
Mountain of Dreams

188
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:51,579
As he walked forward, the gate opened on its own,

189
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:56,772
revealing a quiet space filled with soft white light

190
00:14:56,772 --> 00:15:01,199
In the center stood a simple stone pedestal

191
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,450
On top of it was a small glowing orb

192
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,736
Dara approached it slowly

193
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:14,391
When he touched the orb, the world around him dissolved,

194
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:19,793
and he found himself standing inside what looked like a

195
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:27,326
memory his childhood home, his grandmother cooking rice, his younger

196
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:31,338
self laughing as he ran in the field

197
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:37,821
A voice, the same voice from his dream, whispered, “Your

198
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:40,851
dream is not far away

199
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:43,472
It is inside you

200
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:48,823
”
Then he saw something unexpected—his future self

201
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:58,058
Not rich, not famous, not perfect… but peaceful, confident, smiling,

202
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:05,568
surrounded by people he helped, students he taught, and communities

203
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:08,003
he supported

204
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:15,114
He was not extraordinary because of greatness; he was extraordinary

205
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:19,636
because he lived with purpose and kindness

206
00:16:19,636 --> 00:16:23,063
Tears filled Dara’s eyes

207
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:26,295
He finally understood

208
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:31,197
The Mountain of Dreams does not give people what they

209
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:33,132
want

210
00:16:33,132 --> 00:16:36,811
It reveals what they truly need

211
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:42,996
What Dara needed was clarity, courage, and the belief that

212
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:49,080
he could build a meaningful life—not through magic, but through

213
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,809
effort, compassion, and persistence

214
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:59,240
When the vision faded, he found himself back at the

215
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,162
peak

216
00:17:01,162 --> 00:17:07,180
The orb was gone, replaced by a simple inscription on

217
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,827
the pedestal:
*“Go home

218
00:17:11,827 --> 00:17:14,501
Live your truth

219
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:22,438
”*
Dara descended the mountain slowly, but he was a different

220
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:24,703
person now

221
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:30,149
The doubts from the first valley no longer controlled him

222
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:36,009
The illusions from the second valley no longer confused him

223
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:40,795
The unfinished paths no longer tempted him

224
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:46,476
He understood his journey his real journey was only beginning

225
00:17:46,476 --> 00:17:52,437
When he arrived home days later, his grandmother hugged him

226
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:54,394
tightly

227
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:57,379
“Did you find your dream

228
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:59,621
” she asked

229
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,232
Dara smiled

230
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:06,550
“I found myself,” he replied

231
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:11,769
And from that day on, Dara lived with purpose

232
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:18,411
Not perfect, not without challenges, but with a heart that

233
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:23,542
was no longer afraid to chase what truly mattered

234
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:29,426
His life became an example to others—proof that the greatest

235
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:35,108
dreams are not found in magical mountains, but in the

236
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:39,846
courage to look within and walk forward with hope
